The concept is to connect a basic arduino uno to a sound sensor, a couple of motors and a couple of pez (the candy) dispensers.
Make a program for the arduino so they can input the name of a medecine and link it to a pez dispenser.
When they need to medication they can then just say out loud which medication they need to take and the appropriate dispenser will dispense it.
The benefit of this is that it would avoid any potential complications or accidents that could occur from someone visually impaired
who is on lots of medication accidentally taking the wrong tablet/pill/etc. 

Primarily this is meant as a way for us to practice an learn arduino and C# in the context of a project, but something like this is I think
genuinely useful, especially because the idea of doing it DIY connecting it to pez dispensers means that it would be fairly cheap to use
if someone actually wanted to use it.
